                    <p>
                        Blockchain is a special database which gained popularity 
                        because of cryptocurrencies adopting it, especially bitcoin. 
                        Blockchain development is used together with cryptocurrencies 
                        to implement peer-to-peer (P2P), distributed services. 
                        Blockchain’s primary usage is large, public databases that are 
                        immutable—in other words, they can’t be tampered without 
                        spending massive amounts of resources.<br>
                        Smart Contracts are scripts that can handle money. It’s as simple as that.
                        These contracts are enforced and certified by parties
                        that we call miners.
